# Phi Data Agents

## Basic Understanding Of Agents
- Agents can be build through phidata.
- Phi data agents are useful to give basic understanding of AI agents but there are are some limitations where are some possibilities that agents are not able to understand prompt in few cases and some fuctionalities are not available.
- Agents are autonomous programs that achieve tasks using language models

## How Agents Work
- agent is a program or system that can perform autonomusly by deciding workflow and utilizing tools.
- agents can call tools and information will be obtained  and optimum workflows will be created and subtasks will be formed
- the agent will try to adopt to user expectations.it saves user conversations and takes future action.
- given the user goals and agent available tools the agents divide the task into subtasks (task decomposition) to increase the performance.
- knowledge base is a database of information that agent will search to improve its responses. But many times it does not have additional information. 
- to overcome  this they take help of tools  and  other agents  that provide  them information it recieves it keeps on updating the knowledge base.

## How Learning and Reflection Works
- Due to the user response the knowledge along with user feedback is stored to improve performance.
- if other agent is used for the same task then the multi agent feedback can be used.
- Reasoning paradigms:this think act observe loop are used to solve problems. they are used to improve the responses also.we can instruct the model to reason slowly(break down complex task into simpler one's) and display the thaught.in this context agent updates its context with new reasoning.

## How Storage Works
- Agent-storage:-this will be able to store the sessions
- Agent memory:- is used to classify and store user preferences
